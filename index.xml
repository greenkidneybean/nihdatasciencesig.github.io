Abstract: Many medicines become toxic only after bioactivation by metabolizing enzymes. Often, metabolic enzymes transformed them into chemically reactive species, which subsequently conjugate to proteins and cause adverse events. For example, carbamazepine is epoxidized by P450 enzymes in the liver, but then conjugates to proteins, causing Stevens Johnson Syndrome in some patients. The most difficult to predict drug reactions, idiosyncratic adverse drug reactions, often depend on bioactivation.</description>

      <description>Abstract: Powered by the continuous decrease of the cost of sequencing a single human genome, &amp;laquo;big data&amp;raquo; sequencing studies (&amp;gt;10,000 sample) are becoming common in both industrial and research settings. Recently, several prominent libraries like GATK4, ADAM, and Hail have used Apache Spark to achieve this goal. Apache Spark is a &amp;laquo;map-reduce&amp;raquo;-like system that allows code written in Scala, Java, Python, R, or SQL to be run in parallel across a cluster with hundreds to thousands of cores.</description>

      <description>About the event The NIH will host a Learning and Testing Data Science hackathon on February 23rd, 2018 on the main campus in Bethesda, MD. Learners will test alpha and beta code that have been generated in full, collaborative development hackathons for a wide range of scientific problems, including general bioinformatics and genomic analyses in addition to text, image, and sequence processing. This event is for researchers who are in the early stages of their data science journey, including students and postdocs.</description>

      <description>Do you have massive amounts of data? Have you heard about deep learning and machine learning and would like to learn to utilize these approaches in your research? Join us for the CANDLE workshop to explore one of many ways high-performance computing can be used to tackle cancer research challenges and advance precision oncology.
The CANDLE workshop is a collaboration between the NCI Center for Biomedical Informatics and Information Technology, Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research, and the Department of Energy’s (DOE) National Laboratories (Argonne, Lawrence Livermore, Los Alamos, and Oak Ridge).</description>

      <description>Abstract Deep learning has arisen around 2006 as a renewal of neural networks research allowing such models to have more layers. It is leading the charge of a renewal of AI both inside and outside academia, with billions of dollars being invested and expected fallouts in the trillions by 2030. Theoretical investigations have shown that functions obtained as deep compositions of simpler functions (which includes both deep and recurrent nets) can express highly varying functions (with many ups and downs and different input regions that can be distinguished) much more efficiently (with fewer parameters) than otherwise.</description>
