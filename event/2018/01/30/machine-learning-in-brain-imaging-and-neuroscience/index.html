<h1 id="abstract">Abstract</h1>

<p>Deep learning has arisen around 2006 as a renewal of neural networks
research allowing such models to have more layers. It is leading the
charge of a renewal of AI both inside and outside academia, with
billions of dollars being invested and expected fallouts in the
trillions by 2030. Theoretical investigations have shown that
functions obtained as deep compositions of simpler functions (which
includes both deep and recurrent nets) can express highly varying
functions (with many ups and downs and different input regions that
can be distinguished) much more efficiently (with fewer parameters)
than otherwise. Empirical work in a variety of applications has
demonstrated that, when well trained, such deep architectures can be
highly successful, remarkably breaking through previous
state-of-the-art in many areas, including speech recognition, object
recognition, playing games, language models, machine translation and
transfer learning. In terms of social impact, the most interesting
applications probably are in the medical domain, starting with medical
image analysis but expanding to many other areas. Finally, we
summarize some of the recent work aimed at bridging the remaining gap
between deep learning and neuroscience, including approaches to
implement functional equivalents to backpropagation in a more
biologically plausible way, as well as ongoing work connecting
language, cognition, reinforcement learning and the learning of
abstract representations.</p>

<h2 id="about-the-speaker">About the speaker</h2>

<p>Yoshua Bengio (computer science, 1991, McGill U; post-docs at MIT and
Bell Labs, computer science professor at U. Montr√©al since 1993), he
authored three books, over 300 publications (h-index over 100), mostly
in deep learning, holds a Canada Research Chair in Statistical
Learning Algorithms, is Officer of the Order of Canada, recipient of
the Marie-Victorin Quebec Prize 2017, he is a CIFAR Senior Fellow and
co-directs its Learning in Machines and Brains program. He heads the
Montreal Institute for Learning Algorithms (MILA), currently the
largest academic research group on deep learning. On the NIPS
foundation board (previously program chair and general chair), he
co-created the ICLR conference. His goal is to uncover the principles
of intelligence centered on learning, as well as contribute to the
development of AI for the benefit of all.</p>
