      <description>Do you have massive amounts of data? Have you heard about deep learning and machine learning and would like to learn to utilize these approaches in your research? Join us for the CANDLE workshop to explore one of many ways high-performance computing can be used to tackle cancer research challenges and advance precision oncology.
The CANDLE workshop is a collaboration between the NCI Center for Biomedical Informatics and Information Technology, Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research, and the Department of Energyâ€™s (DOE) National Laboratories (Argonne, Lawrence Livermore, Los Alamos, and Oak Ridge).</description>

      <description>Abstract Deep learning has arisen around 2006 as a renewal of neural networks research allowing such models to have more layers. It is leading the charge of a renewal of AI both inside and outside academia, with billions of dollars being invested and expected fallouts in the trillions by 2030. Theoretical investigations have shown that functions obtained as deep compositions of simpler functions (which includes both deep and recurrent nets) can express highly varying functions (with many ups and downs and different input regions that can be distinguished) much more efficiently (with fewer parameters) than otherwise.</description>
